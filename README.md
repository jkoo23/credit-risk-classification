# credit-risk-classification

In this challenge, various techniques are used to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company, I build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
From sklearn, I used train_test_split to build the models. Then used balanced_accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, amd classification_report to describe the accuracy and precision of the models.
